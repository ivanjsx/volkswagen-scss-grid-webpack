# Volkswagen T1 Electro

## Project Description

This project showcases an article page dedicated to the **Volkswagen T1 Electro**, designed to function as either an article for an automotive magazine or a landing page for the car manufacturerâ€™s website. The page is fully responsive across various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience.

The development of the page follows **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** and the **BEM methodology**, ensuring that the code is highly maintainable and scalable for future server-side integration. The project utilizes a custom build process with **Webpack** and **Babel**, and the CSS is further optimized with **PostCSS** for performance improvements.

## See It In Action

The page is optimized for **desktop, tablet, and mobile devices** and can be viewed live at [vw-t1e.ivanjsx.com](https://vw-t1e.ivanjsx.com).

## My Role In It

I was responsible for the entire development process, starting from the initial [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/G3UWFlQmNtNs67751YiDH2/Month-of-Landings_external-link) to the final deployment. This included setting up the project architecture, implementing the responsive layout, and optimizing the build process. 

I ensured the codebase adheres to **OOP principles** and **BEM methodology**, making the project easily extensible and ready for future enhancements.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structuring the page content
- **SCSS** (a subset of [SASS](https://sass-lang.com)) for styling
- **JavaScript** for adding interactivity
- **Webpack** for asset bundling and managing the build process
- **Babel** for JavaScript transpilation, ensuring cross-browser compatibility
- **BEM methodology** for clean and maintainable CSS architecture
- **PostCSS** for optimizing CSS (including **cssnano** for minification and **autoprefixer** for vendor prefixing)
- **Flexbox, Grid Layout, and media queries** for responsive design across devices
- **Object-Oriented Programming** for structuring the JavaScript code
- **Docker** for containerizing the project
- **Nginx** for serving the project in a production environment
- **Let's Encrypt** for SSL certificate generation
